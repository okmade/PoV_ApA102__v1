# PoV_ApA102__v1
 PoV - Persistence of Vision using Addressable strip led (ApA 102), controlled by Web.


This Project have been built by Cesar Barrios (Okmade).
This Project started as a personal project, to show my students features they can reach with different skill about Microcontroller.


* Hardware:
    * BStructure made with 3d Printer (Ender 3)
    * ESP8266 NodeMCU (WIFI)
    * Addressable strip led (ApA 102), 144 per Meter (46 Used)
    * 15:1 Micro Metal Gearmotor HPCB 6V
    * DRV8838 Single Brushed DC Motor Driver Carrier
    * Mini-360 DC-DC Converter Step Down Module
    * KY-003 hall effect magnetic sensor module
    * Comidox 12.5mm 300Rpm 6 Wires CIRCUITSx2A Capsule Electrical Slip Ring
    * Battery 7.4v/5000mA

* Software:
    * Arduino App
    * Libraries for ESP8266


Versions:
* v0.1: First Structure wass made
* v0.2: First Code to control APA102
* v0.3: Code with World in Background and custom Message moving
* v0.3.1: Images and video uploaded

Next:
* Upload structure in 3D
* Code to Control by Web
* Decode Image or video to manege in Real Time
* App for phones


Issues: I try to fix as many I can find, software has been changed a lot over time, because I always find a better way to develop project.
